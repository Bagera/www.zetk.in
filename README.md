# Zetkin Activist Portal, www.zetk.in
This is the main front-end for Zetkin, the platform for organizing activism.

Zetkin is developed by the Zetkin Foundation and friends. If you want to learn
more about Zetkin or help out with development, you can find more information
at [the Zetkin Foundation website](http://www.zetkin.org) or
[The Zetkin Manual](http://manual.zetkin.org).

## Getting started
To get started with development you need [Docker](https://www.docker.com).
Once you have Docker installed, build the container:

```bash
$ ./bin/build_dev
```

Docker will download all the requirements and create an image which you can
then use to run the Zetkin Activist portal on your local port 80.

```bash
$ ./bin/run_dev
```

The development version contains build scripts, component hot loading and
other features to ease development.

Edit your hosts file (e.g. `/etc/hosts`) to contain a line that maps
www.dev.zetkin.org to your localhost.

```
127.0.0.1       www.dev.zetkin.org
```

This ensures that you can sign in to your local version of the portal using the
development version of the Zetkin Platform API (api.dev.zetkin.org). Just point
your browser to www.dev.zetkin.org, which is now your local version, and start
using it. Edit javascript code and components will be reloaded instantly in
your browser.

__NOTE__: SCSS files are not hot reloaded. You must reload the page, or install
a browser extension to reload just the CSS files, to see changes after editing
SCSS.
